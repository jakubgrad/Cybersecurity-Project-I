This repository contains my code for Project I, a last part of Cybersecurity course at University of Helsinki.

The code is an implementation of a web application containing 5 OWASP security risks and their respective fixes. To start the application, download the repository and read in the virtual environment, e.g.:
```
cd Cybersecurity-Project-I
source venv/bin/activate
cd mysite
python3 manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```
The server should be running at localhost:8000.
