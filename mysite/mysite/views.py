    # FLAW 4
    # A02:2021-Cryptographic Failures
    # SHA-1 is an insecure algorithm because it's fast to compute,
    # which means an attacker can try to generate many hashes for
    # common passwords in order to find a match once they compromise
    # the database or use a list from the internet of known hashes. 
    # E.g. I found the password "admin" from a hash of it online.
    return hashlib.sha1(password.encode()).hexdigest()
    
    # FIX 4
    # Have a strong policy for passwords when registering users.
    # E.g., don't allow passwords from public repositories of 
    # popular passwords. Also, use a stronger encryption algorithm,
    # e.g. sha256 as suggested in this fix:
    #return hashlib.sha256(data).hexdigest()

        # to edit your blog. It sounds unlikely but I've personally used tools that didn't always
        # work when you clicked log out (I've noticed it was even happening to Facebook a few 
        # years ago). For FIX 3 scroll to the bottom of this file to the logout function!
